# Removed Features Readded
The whole point of this mod is to bring dead/removed features from older versions of Minecraft back into the modern version of the game, and optimize them to be both performant and fun!

Right now the mod can be installed on EITHER the client or the server, doesn't need to be on both, HOWEVER this will change when I add new mobs, and new blocks, when this happens it will need to be on both the client and the server (unless you're in single player, that will be client only)

## Where to download (TODO)
~~You can download the latest version from modrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/removed-features-readded~~


## Features
Below is a list of current, and planned features!

- [ ] Ability to toggle all options (SERVER ONLY)
- [x] Mobs run away when a creeper explodes
- [ ] Steve Mob (In a different way than just a test mob, and give it some real AI)
- [ ] ?Herobrine Mob? (This could be a counterpart to Steve and an small chance of happening, I mean mojang does say they remove him in every update, so technically a removed feature)
